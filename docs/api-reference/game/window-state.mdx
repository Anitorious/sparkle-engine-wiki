# WindowState

The `WindowState` enum provides flags for configuring the behavior and appearance of the game window, including fullscreen mode, resizing, and visual properties.

:::note

`WindowState` is a flags enum, meaning multiple values can be combined using the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to create complex window configurations. For example, `WindowState.FullScreen | WindowState.Borderless` creates a fullscreen borderless window.

- **Namespace:** Bliss.CSharp.Windowing
- **Type:** `[Flags] enum`

---

## Features

The `WindowState` enum provides configuration for:

- **Window modes** — Fullscreen, borderless, windowed, and hidden states
- **Window sizing** — Resizable, maximized, and minimized states
- **Visual properties** — Always-on-top, transparent, and high-DPI support
- **Input handling** — Mouse capture for confined cursor movement

## Usage

```csharp
using Bliss.CSharp.Windowing;

var settings = new GameSettings {
    // Single flag
    WindowFlags = WindowState.Resizable
};

var settings = new GameSettings {
    // Multiple flags combined
    WindowFlags = WindowState.FullScreen | WindowState.Borderless
};
```

## Enum Values

### None

```csharp
None = 0
```

Indicates that the window has no specific state. The window will use default platform-specific behavior.

**Example:**

```csharp
var settings = new GameSettings {
    WindowFlags = WindowState.None
};
```

---

### Resizable

```csharp
Resizable = 1
```

The window is resizable, allowing the user to adjust its dimensions by dragging the window edges or corners.

**Example:**

```csharp
var settings = new GameSettings {
    WindowFlags = WindowState.Resizable
};
```

---

### FullScreen

```csharp
FullScreen = 2
```

The window is in full-screen mode, occupying the entire screen with no visible task bar or other windows.

**Example:**

```csharp
var settings = new GameSettings {
    WindowFlags = WindowState.FullScreen
};
```

---

### Borderless

```csharp
Borderless = FullScreen | Resizable (0x00000003)
```

The window is borderless, removing the title bar and window borders while maintaining windowed mode. This creates a "fake fullscreen" effect that can be faster to switch in/out of.

**Example:**

```csharp
var settings = new GameSettings {
    WindowFlags = WindowState.Borderless
};
```

---

### Maximized

```csharp
Maximized = 4
```

The window is maximized, taking up the largest possible area on the screen while still showing the title bar and window borders.

**Example:**

```csharp
var settings = new GameSettings {
    WindowFlags = WindowState.Maximized
};
```

---

### Minimized

```csharp
Minimized = Maximized | Resizable (0x00000005)
```

The window is minimized, reducing it to an icon in the taskbar or a minimized window button.

**Example:**

```csharp
var settings = new GameSettings {
    WindowFlags = WindowState.Minimized
};
```

---

### Hidden

```csharp
Hidden = Maximized | FullScreen (0x00000006)
```

The window is hidden and not visible to the user. Useful for creating invisible windows or temporarily hiding the main window.

**Example:**

```csharp
var settings = new GameSettings {
    WindowFlags = WindowState.Hidden
};
```

---

### CaptureMouse

```csharp
CaptureMouse = Hidden | Resizable (0x00000007)
```

The window captures the mouse, confining its movement to the window area. Useful for first-person games or when you need exclusive mouse control.

**Example:**

```csharp
var settings = new GameSettings {
    WindowFlags = WindowState.CaptureMouse
};
```

---

### AlwaysOnTop

```csharp
AlwaysOnTop = 8
```

The window is always on top of other windows, maintaining its topmost position even when not focused.

**Example:**

```csharp
var settings = new GameSettings {
    WindowFlags = WindowState.AlwaysOnTop
};
```

---

### Transparent

```csharp
Transparent = AlwaysOnTop | Resizable (0x00000009)
```

The window is transparent, allowing content behind it to be partially visible. Often combined with alpha blending in the renderer.

**Example:**

```csharp
var settings = new GameSettings {
    WindowFlags = WindowState.Transparent
};
```

---

### HighPixelDensity

```csharp
HighPixelDensity = AlwaysOnTop | FullScreen (0x0000000A)
```

Enables rendering optimized for high-DPI (high pixel density) displays, such as Retina displays on macOS. The renderer will use the appropriate scaling factors automatically.

**Example:**

```csharp
var settings = new GameSettings {
    WindowFlags = WindowState.HighPixelDensity
};
```
